## Overview
This repository highlights a project focused on creating a social network application. It introduces the User, Database, and SocialNetwork classes that form the core of the application. The User class represents individual users, the Database class manages user and friendship data, and the SocialNetwork class includes a login mechanism. By simulating a social network, users can access features like viewing profiles, updating names, and exploring friends' lists within the application.
